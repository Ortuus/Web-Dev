Hi!

My Name is Adam McKeown. 
I'm a freelance web developer in Northern West Virginia and this project is a simple boilerplate
template sorta deal so that anyone can use and make changes to it fairly easily.

This version features only a bit of raw HTML and CSS, with very very very..... very minimal JS.
In future versions I will be adding apparent comments so that areas become more apparent so that you can switch out information
and I will also be implemeting more advanced JS and JQuery items as I revisit the project.

I'm tired, it's 1:00AM, and I have work in 5 hours. Cheers!
